# Active Context: Personal E-Commerce Application

This document tracks the current work focus, recent changes, and next steps for the e-commerce application.

## 1. Current Work Focus

The current focus is on implementing authentication using **Microsoft Entra External ID**. This involves configuring the new External ID tenant, registering the frontend application, creating user flows, and integrating the Angular application with MSAL.


## 2. Recent Changes

- **Pivoted Authentication Provider:** Made the key architectural decision to switch from the legacy Azure AD B2C to the modern **Microsoft Entra External ID** after discovering B2C is no longer available for new customers.
- **Created External ID Tenant:** Successfully created the new tenant.
- **SASS Structure Refactor:** Refactored the SASS (7-1) structure to use index files for each folder and consolidated imports in `main.scss` for clarity and maintainability. Updated import order to: abstracts → base → layout → components → vendors → themes.
- **Updated Memento:** Updated `projectbrief.md`, `techContext.md`, and `systemPatterns.md` to reflect the pivot to Microsoft Entra External ID and SASS structure improvements.

## 3. Next Steps

- **Register the SPA in Entra External ID:** Create a new application registration for the Angular frontend.
- **Create a User Flow:** Set up a "Sign up and sign in" user flow for customers.
- **Configure Angular with MSAL:**
  - Install MSAL packages.
  - Configure the MSAL module with the new tenant's details (Client ID, Authority).
  - Implement login/logout functionality.
- **Update `progress.md`:** Reflect the new authentication tasks in the progress tracker.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Authentication Pivot:** The decision to use Microsoft Entra External ID is final. This ensures the project is built on a modern, supported platform. All new authentication work will be based on this technology.
