# Active Context: Personal E-Commerce Application

This document tracks the current work focus, recent changes, and next steps for the e-commerce application.

## 1. Current Work Focus

The current focus is on the initial project setup and documentation. We are establishing the foundational context for the project by creating the Memento files. This ensures that the project's goals, architecture, and technical stack are clearly defined before any code is written.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **Initialized Memento:** Created the core Memento documentation:
  - `projectbrief.md`: Defines the overall project scope and goals.
  - `productContext.md`: Outlines the product vision and user experience goals.
  - `systemPatterns.md`: Describes the microservices architecture and design patterns.
  - `techContext.md`: Details the technical stack and development environment.

## 3. Next Steps

- **Create `progress.md`:** The final core Memento file, `progress.md`, needs to be created to track the project's status, what is working, and what is left to build.
- **Establish `.aiderules`:** Create the `.aiderules` file to start capturing project-specific patterns and intelligence.
- **Begin Scaffolding:** Once the Memento is fully established, the next logical step is to begin scaffolding the project structure, starting with the frontend Angular application and the initial backend microservices.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Memento First:** The immediate decision is to complete the Memento documentation before proceeding with any development. This ensures a solid foundation and clear direction for the project.
